        <h1>Hello world!</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>My name is:</strong>
            Nathan Katz
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>My email address is:</strong>
            nathankatz@wustl.edu
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>I am taking this class because:</strong>
            I have always been facinated with web design and am tired of paying Wix to make my website.
            I am very interested in design and frequently take on projects that are creating sites.
            I plan on majoring in entrepreneurship and this is a useful skill to have as part of my major.
            This course will also continue my interest in computer science! I hope to get off the waitlist.
